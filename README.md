# Neighbourhood_Based_LM_Method_for_Neural_Network_Training
# The project mainly uses LM method to train a neural network.
# Comparative analysis has been carried out with other training methods such as Back Propagation (BP) and Scaled Conjugate methods.
# The neighbourhood based LM method employed here uses different number of neurons in each layer and also different number of hidden layers. The number of weights do not matter a lot in this case.
# The comparison for different methods is carried out for electric nose, function approximation, fluid flow and image processing fields.
# The observations are carried out for different number of neurons in the hidden layer and also for different number of hidden layers.
# The results are studied using graphs obtained in MATLAB.
